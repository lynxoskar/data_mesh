Several companies have successfully implemented data mesh principles to improve their data management and analytics capabilities. Here are some examples:

## Intuit

Intuit, the financial software company, adopted data mesh to address challenges with data discoverability, understandability, trust, and use[1]. They wanted to empower their data workers to create and own high-quality data-driven systems. By implementing data mesh:

- They developed a system where data workers became responsible for designing, developing, and supporting data-driven systems.
- This approach helped resolve issues around data ownership and access, improving efficiency and data utilization across the organization.

## JP Morgan Chase

JP Morgan Chase implemented a data mesh approach as part of their cloud-first strategy to modernize their platform[1]. Their implementation included:

- Creating an environment where each business line (data domain) could create and own its data lake end-to-end.
- Interconnecting all data products while maintaining standardized data governance policies.
- Using a metadata catalog to track lineage and provenance, ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness.

This approach helped JP Morgan Chase cut costs, unlock new opportunities, and improve data reusability across the organization.

## Saxo Bank

Saxo Bank, a European online investment bank, partnered with Thoughtworks to implement data mesh[4]. Their implementation focused on:

- Creating a data workbench to make data assets searchable and discoverable.
- Implementing a business catalog with consistent business definitions.
- Providing product descriptions, usage metrics, and user feedback for each data asset to ensure trustworthiness.

As a result, Saxo Bank saw reduced customer acquisition costs, more efficient operations, and improved regulatory compliance.

## Large Industrial Company

An unnamed large industrial company successfully implemented data mesh principles[5]:

- They established self-service dashboards enabling staff to discover existing data products and build individual reports.
- This effort, combined with a communications campaign, activated 300 new data users.
- The company significantly improved data engagement and utilization across the organization.

## Large Mining Organization

A large mining organization transformed its data landscape using data mesh principles[5]:

- Before implementation, they had hundreds of siloed operational databases worldwide, and developing analytics use cases took months.
- After shifting to a data mesh approach, they:
  - Dramatically reduced time spent on data-engineering activities.
  - Developed use cases seven times faster than before.
  - Increased data stability and reusability.

These examples demonstrate that companies across various industries, from finance to mining, have successfully leveraged data mesh principles to improve their data management, increase data utilization, and drive business value. The common themes include decentralized data ownership, improved data discoverability, and faster time-to-value for data-driven initiatives.
