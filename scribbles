| Data Governance | Centralized policies | Federated, domain-specific policies |
| Data Quality | Managed by central team | Responsibility of domain teams |
| Scalability | Can become a bottleneck | More scalable due to decentralization |
| Innovation | Often slower due to centralization | Faster, domain-specific innovation |
